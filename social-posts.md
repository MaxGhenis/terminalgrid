Running multiple Claude Code sessions? VS Code's terminal panel only splits in one direction—no 2D grids.

I built TerminalGrid to fix this. Cmd+K Cmd+Right, Cmd+K Cmd+Down—true grid layouts.

VS Code has rejected this feature request since 2018. No other extension solves it.

TerminalGrid moves terminals to the editor area, where grids already work.

Also: auto-launches Claude/Aider/Codex, names terminals by folder, crash recovery.

### Main Post

If you're running parallel Claude Code, Aider, or other AI coding sessions, you know the pain: VS Code's terminal panel only splits in one direction. No 2D grids.

This has been requested since 2018. Microsoft hasn't built it.

So I did.

TerminalGrid is a VS Code extension that moves terminals to the editor area—where VS Code already supports full 2D layouts. Simple keyboard shortcuts:

• Cmd+K Cmd+Right → split right
• Cmd+K Cmd+Down → split down
• Cmd+K Cmd+N → new terminal with project picker

It auto-launches your AI coding tool of choice, names terminals by folder, and persists layouts through crashes.

Free and open source. Link in comments.
